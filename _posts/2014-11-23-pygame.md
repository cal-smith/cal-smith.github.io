Pygame has some trouble running on certian OS X configurations, and tends to do some funny things on retina mac's, this is a quick run-down of installing pygame from source.

This assumes a working knowledge of the terminal.

We are going to use some handy software to get pygame installed:

- [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) a package manager for OSX. quite simply it lets us install software and tools from the terminal
- [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) a package manager for python, its used to install lots of useful python libraries.

First we need homebrew, so pop the command from the site -- `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` -- into your terminal and follow the prompts.  
Next we need pip, following the linked site is probably a good idea, but the gist is to download [this file](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run: `python get-pip.py`  
In order to get all the right versions of pygame and it's dependencies we need a little program called mercurial, used for managing source code, so run: `brew install mercurial`  
Next we need to install some dependencies for pygame: `brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi`  
And finally pygame itself: `sudo pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`  
The sudo command tells the system that we want to make changes as a kind of "super-administrator", and is needed for pip to install things.

And with that everything should work fine.
