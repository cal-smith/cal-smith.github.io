##Why building a "blog" on GitHub Pages is both awesome and infuriating

So I did it, I built a "blog". I guess that offcialy makes me a blogger? In any event my platform of choice was GitHub's Pages service, It's fast, free, supports custom domains, has a really nice static site generator built in, is free, uses git/GitHub to manage everything, and did I mention it's free? Needless to say I<3GitHub and just about everything blah

The big missing hole is documentation

building templates from scratch, very little usefull info, lots of "hidden doors" and unexplained concepts. ruby and ruby applications tend to have a lot of "magic", and this can be both a blessing and a curse. is jekyll *too* magical?
